          <h2>Jack the Cat</h2>
          <p>While technically not a thing, Jack the cat is my number one favorite. Jack passed away last summer but was adorably photogenic, as you can see, even in his old age. Jack&#8217;s many human and kitty friends miss him very much!</p>

          <h2>Tiny House Envy</h2>
          <p>I adore tiny houses and hope to design and build one myself someday. The tiny home in this photo belongs to Alek, Anjali, and their dog Anya. I was thrilled to meet Alek and Anjali at the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TinyHouseConference" target="_blank">Tiny House Conference</a> this past April. In addition to designing tiny houses, Alek also designs websites. Check out both his talents! There&#8217;s an excellent interview and video tour of their home on Alek&#8217;s <a href="http://tiny-project.com/watch-our-tiny-house-video-tour-and-interview-by-faircompanies-com/" target="_blank">Tiny Project</a> website.</p>

          <p>If you&#8217;re ever in Portland, there&#8217;s a fantastic restaurant named <a href="http://portobellopdx.com/" target="_blank">Portobello</a> that serves the best beet burgers ever. There are lots of great places to eat in Portland, but if you&#8217;re a fan of veggie burgers, here&#8217;s a fun and informative article about the top-rated burgers in town. <a href="http://www.portlandmercury.com/portland/the-great-veggie-burger-caper/Content?oid=15864609" target="_blank">Two Comedians Take on Portland&#8217;s Meatless Burgers</a></p>
